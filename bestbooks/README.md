# Bestbooks

Welcome to your new gem! This gem is for language lovers, Italian in this case. This app provides a CLI to the Mondadori Store, where you will find a list of the best seller books in Italian. You will be able to see the title, the author and publishing house from it.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bestbooks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bestbooks

## Usage

Run: ./bestbooks'cli'app/bin/bestbooks and you will be given the list of top 10 books in Italian. You can then input the number that represents the book youâ€™d like more information on.
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
